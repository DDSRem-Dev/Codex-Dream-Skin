# Notices

Codex Dream Skin Studio is an **unofficial** customization project and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by OpenAI**.

## Software license

The MIT License in `LICENSE` applies to the **software source code** in this repository (scripts, CSS, injectors, docs that describe the software, and the abstract demo asset generated for this repo).

It does **not** grant rights to:

- OpenAI or Codex trademarks, product names, logos, or trade dress
- Official Codex / ChatGPT application binaries, `.app` bundles, or `app.asar`
- Any user-supplied images or third-party artwork you drop into a theme
- Character likenesses, franchise art, or celebrity imagery

## Demo artwork

`assets/portal-hero.png` is original abstract geometric art generated for this open-source repository (no characters). Replace it with your own image before shipping a branded theme to customers.

`themes/mizuki-25ji/mizuki-25ji.jpg` is optional third-party character artwork supplied for this theme preset. It is not covered by the MIT License. *Project SEKAI*, 25時、ナイトコードで。, and 暁山瑞希 belong to their respective rights holders; their inclusion does not imply endorsement.

## Runtime

This project does not redistribute Node.js. At runtime it validates and uses the Node.js executable already signed and bundled inside the user's official Codex desktop application.

## Security model

Themes are applied through Chromium DevTools Protocol on **loopback only**. While a themed session is running, treat the local debugging port as sensitive: do not run untrusted local software that could attach to it. Use the Restore launcher to tear down the themed session and debugging port.
